By simply typing your location id, the currency you want to pay, and the language you speak, the function will generates a list of restaurants near you. The list contains the name of the restaurant, its price level, ratings, description and a photo url of it.


```python
from restaurantapi_pyclient.restaurantapi_pyclient import query_restaurants_in_location

# Test the query_restaurants_in_location function
api_key = os.environ.get('RES_API')
location_id = '45963'
language = "en_US"
currency = "USD"

result = query_restaurants_in_location(api_key, location_id, language, currency)

    Text: The service is so slow and not up to the expectations of a recommended place for breakfast. Cleaning the tables does not seem a priority. Not enough personnel makes this place so inefficient. The food is good but looks better than it tastes. I may give it another try with hopes they improve because their location is so beautiful.

    Text: The cafe is great, the bakery was great too and the crew was very efficient, but the manager (only one with a suit) was disrespectful and rude.   One customer before me asked him about what comes with the eggs and he just responded that the answer was on the menu!  I asked for our coffees and he responded he didn‚Äôt make them as he was waiting for us to come for it.   I loved Zeppola, both, in NY and in LV‚Äôs but people like this just speak very bad about a company.  If he treats customers like this, he probable treats employees even worst.

    Text: We had tea, coffee and a fruit tart here, the customer service left a lot to be desired, the person serving us was miserable and it showed, no thankyou or conversation. The fruit tart was the most expensive pastry we had on the Strip and it was the smallest with little fruit especially for the price. We sat upstairs overlooking St Marks Square so at least the location is good, but we would not be back as there as so many better cafe's in the area.
