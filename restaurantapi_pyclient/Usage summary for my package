      "Text: We had tea, coffee and a fruit tart here, the customer service left a lot to be desired, the person serving us was miserable and it showed, no thankyou or conversation. The fruit tart was the most expensive pastry we had on the Strip and it was the smallest with little fruit especially for the price. We sat upstairs overlooking St Marks Square so at least the location is good, but we would not be back as there as so many better cafe's in the area. \n",
